# Default Configs

This repo holds the default configs we apply to our repos.

The files can just be copied into the new repo and then modified as needed.

# Special Case Rubocop

Rubocop supports inheriting from a remote URL, this means you don't have to copy `rubocop-default-config.yml` into your new repo.
